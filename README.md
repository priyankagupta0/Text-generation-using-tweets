# Text-generation-using-tweets
In this project, the objective is to generate tweets using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) models based on Donald Trump's tweets related to Russia. By utilizing natural language processing (NLP) techniques and LSTM, we aim to develop a model that can generate new tweets in a similar style and context as those specifically focusing on Russia.

Used the following dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivammehta007/trump-tweetcsv and preprocessed the tweet data using NLP techniques (removing stop words, handling punctuation, tokenization, etc.), then trained the LSTM model on the preprocessed text data
